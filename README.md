# RubixCubeSolver
Website that enables user to enter their rubix cube and will use path finding algorithms to solve the rubix cube and return the result to the user

This website will start by simply allowing the user to solve a rubix cube on the website
This will be from 2 methods, starting from a complete cube, or the user inputting their own cube into the website

Once that has been completed, the path finding algorithms and AI to solve the cube will then start to be implemented
